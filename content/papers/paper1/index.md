description: "Multilingual Hate Speech Detection and Target Identification in Devanagari-Scripted Languages" 
summary: "Accepted at Chipsal @ COLING 2025. This study addresses hate speech detection and target identification in Devanagari-scripted languages (Hindi, Marathi, Nepali, Bhojpuri, Sanskrit). Subtask B focuses on detecting hate speech, while Subtask C identifies specific targets, such as individuals or communities. The proposed **MultilingualRobertaClass** model, based on the ia-multilingual-transliterated-roberta transformer, uses contextualized embeddings for multilingual and transliterated contexts. It achieved 88.40% accuracy in Subtask B and 66.11% in Subtask C on the test set."

##### Abstract

This work focuses on two subtasks related to hate speech detection and target identification in Devanagari-scripted languages, specifically Hindi, Marathi, Nepali, Bhojpuri, and Sanskrit. Subtask B involves detecting hate speech in online text, while Subtask C requires identifying the specific targets of hate speech, such as individuals, organizations, or communities. We propose the MultilingualRobertaClass model, a deep neural network built on the pretrained multilingual transformer model ia-multilingual-transliterated-roberta, optimized for classification tasks in multilingual and transliterated contexts. The model leverages contextualized embeddings to handle linguistic diversity, with a classifier head for binary classification. We received 88.40% accuracy in Subtask B and 66.11% accuracy in Subtask C, in the test set.
